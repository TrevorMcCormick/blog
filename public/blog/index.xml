I just finished taking the A Cloud Guru - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C02 course

If you&amp;rsquo;re completely unfamiliar with those, it may benefit you to learn or review some introductory computing concepts.

Harvard CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science
This course features one of my favorite professors of all time &amp;ndash; David Malan
