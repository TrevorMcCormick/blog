I'm 28 years old, living in Wyandotte with my wife Haley, and our dog Captain.  

I work in marketing technology and data engineering at General Motors. I'm leading the data activation team to build out our customer data platform.

This website was designed to publish thoughts, how-to's, resources, notes, and everything in-between. I write about data and marketing.
