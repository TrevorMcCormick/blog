This website was designed to publish thoughts, how-to's, resources, notes, and everything in-between. I write about data and marketing.

I work in marketing technology and data engineering at General Motors. I'm leading the data activation team to build out our customer data platform.

I live in Wyandotte, Michigan with my wife Haley, and our dog Captain.
