## Status

I am currently scheduled to take the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam in March 2021. I just finished taking the [A Cloud Guru - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C02 course](https://acloud.guru/overview/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate), and I'm continuing to refine my knowledge gaps by building some test projects within AWS before I take the exam.

Advice so far: 
* read through every major service FAQ: IAM, S3, EC2, RDS, VPC, CloudFront, and Route53
* draw out AWS architecture diagrams by hand, and be able to draw out full solutions by memory
* know the highly-available architecture best practices by heart
* the philosophy of the AWS business model shines through every service
* there are tons of resources on individual components of AWS, so if you don't understand something, chances are there are in-depth articles explaining it
